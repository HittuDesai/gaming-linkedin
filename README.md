Intragram clone that offers limited functionality like register/signin, modifying profile, and uploading a profile picture.

This was my first attempt at building a full-stack project that interacts with a database. This was also my first time using a component library for the frontend IIRC.

This could very well be my first time using Next.js in a project considering the way I structured my app to look like an SPA.

I no longer plan on maintaining this project.
